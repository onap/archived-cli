Both Information and Communication Technology customers prefer Command Line
Interface (CLI) over Graphical user interface (GUI) in many situations
such as automation, devops, CI&CD. So CLI is always been as integral part
of software products and platforms.

ONAP CLI provides the command line interface for ONAP functionalities and in
Amesterdam release, it provides commands for following features:

* ONAP micro-service discovery
* ONAP external system and VNF cloud on-boarding
* ONAP customer and subscription management
* ONAP VSP on-boarding
* ONAP network service life-cycle management

ONAP CLI is developed using the industry first CLI platform called
**Open CLI Platform (oclip)** which is part of ONAP CLI deliverables.
